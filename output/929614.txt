a good deal more laudable to try to finish what I have started, than to take on new burdens which I know I could not possibly finish. The only effect of adding another burden would be to ruin the whole programme by making me incapable of any mental concentration or continuous work whatever.

There are only so many hours that I can work; and when all of these are crowded to the limit--with much still undone--it is plainly absurd to suppose that I could take on more tasks. When could I perform them? I often have to stay in a week or more at a time, working virtually night and day, in order to keep abreast of my schedule. On every one of my trips I have had to take along so much work that time for sightseeing and relaxation has been reduced to a meagre minimum. Now my work is getting poor and full of mistakes--the mistakes due to sheer exhaustion. I cannot do more. Instead, I must do less. Rest at any cost is, from sheer necessity, my present motto. I am conducting a sort of revolution, with its concomitant declaration of independence, in sheer self-defence. That is how I pulled out of similar semi-collapses in '06 and '08, and '16. To call such collapses mere illusions of 'auto-hypnosis' or trivial results of smoking (I don't smoke) is simply to miss the point.

Well, as I said last time, I was sorry to hear that other revisions were so hard to get--hence suggested that I might try to handle at least one of your miss. little by little, if no time limit whatever were imposed. I certainly could not have started now, since jobs already contracted for will take all my time and more for 2 or 3 months. That is why I had to transfer the recent novel job to Moe. I left it to you whether you could derive any benefit from any arrangement that I conceivably could make--i.e., some plan not involving much work till next spring or summer, and without a specified time of delivery. Otherwise, I would of course
