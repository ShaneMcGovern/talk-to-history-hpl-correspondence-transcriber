laymen's opinions must necessarily be. All I can do is to judge at third or fourth hand--relying on the extent to which real scholars agree or disagree--of the validity of the sources on which various historians base their arguments. I must endeavour to see a copy of your "Jewish Forerunners of Christianity" --which must be an extremely interesting and historically revealing book all apart from its bearing on the present topic. Too bad it is now out of print--or perhaps that is not so unfortunate after all, since you say that its method of approach to its theme is not what you would prefer to use today. I'll see if any of the local libraries have a copy.
