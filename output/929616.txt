have to admit that I am not able to consider any new work of substantial magnitude. And it might indeed be the wisest policy not to undertake anything--for whatever fragmentary schedule I could promise would seem messy and dilatory to you, and would have over me as a sort of impending burden...perhaps impairing the value of my imperative and immediate work. It might be far better for me to assume no fresh obligations until my present schedule is under control--and then to notify you of my ability to consider matters, unless you by that time find another suitable reviser. At any rate, I must first finish what is already started--and that can't be done by crowding my overfilled programme still more, and making making my mind less and less capable of continuous concentration or effective results. What I must do is to cut out everything which possibly can be cut out, so that I can finish--with the proper quality attainable only through a decently rested mind--those things which cannot under any circumstances be cut out. I'd like to help--but the best I could do just now, even at the cost of mental torture and dangerous nerve-strain, would not be of very substantial assistance.
