concentration or continuous work whatever.

There are only so many hours that I can work; it when all of these are crowded to the limit - with much still undone - it is plainly absurd to suppose that I could take on more tasks. When could I perform these? I often have to stay in a week or more at a time, working virtually night and day, in order to keep ahead of my schedule. On every one of my trips I have had to take along so much work that time for rest and relaxation has been reduced to a minimum. Now my work is getting poor and full of mistakes - these mistakes are due to sheer exhaustion. I cannot do more. Instead, I must do less. Rest at any cost is, from sheer necessity, my present motto. I am conducting a sort of revolution, with its concomitant declaration of independence, in sheer self-defence. That is how I pulled out of similar crises - collapses in '05 & '08 & '16. To call such collapses mere illusions of 'auto-compassion' or trivial results of smoking [] don't smoke] is simply to miss the point.

Well, as I said last time, I was sorry to hear that other necrologists were so hard to get - hence suggested that I might try to handle it - if no time limit whatever were imposed. I certainly could not have started now, since jobs already contracted for will take all my time if more for 2 or 3 months. That is why I had to transfer the recent novel job to Else.

Otherwise, I would of course have to admit that I am not able to consider any new work of substantial magnitude. And it might indeed be the wisest policy not to undertake anything - for whatever fragmentary schedule I could promise would seem messy. If dealing with you, it would hang over me as a
