It is well,
I am of course too poor a business-man to judge. XXXXXXXX, however, XA not to be unduly optimistic; since even in case of publication a lucrative sale can by no means be counted on. Still, that would not form any good reason against the undertaking of the project if it were feasible; since the presentation of a powerful argument, XA indeed any enrichment of scholarship, is a primary end in itself. So, as indicated above, I'll surely let you know whenever I can tackle any new task of the sort--unless previously notified that you have secured another collaborator. In any event, I hope the ultimate outcome will be favourable.

Perforce, I have to rely on the statements of others regarding the authenticity of this or that historical source. It is years since I have given this field any attention; and even in the past my attention was merely that of a superficial reader driven into occasional shallow delving in order to justify my complete absence of all religious belief.
