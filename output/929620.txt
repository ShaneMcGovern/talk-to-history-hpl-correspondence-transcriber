almost reasons for not believing in such: first, the fact that it is the most awkward and least evidentially justified of all possible explanations of things; and second, that it is so obviously a human invention a product of the animistic attribution of human qualities to the non-human and abstract. Thus to me all traditional consideration of religion seems essentially irrelevant, and even trivial except in connexion with historical and anthropological research. We can see too plainly behind all religions to take any of them seriously, or to prefer any one of them to any other except in terms of social, intellectual, and ethical effects. So far as truth or justification is concerned, they are all alike-xaxa hence I can look upon their tales and characters....Zeus, Brahma, Odin, Alura-Magoda, Gitchie-Manitou, Jesus, Gautama, Yahwe, Mohammad, Moses, Quetzalcoatl, Maroni, Mary Baker Eddy, Damballah, the angel, and all the rest....only with such objective and analytical detachment as one finds in Frazer's "Golden Bough". What interest I have in the well-known religions of the ancient and modern world is purely historical--measured by their effect on the stream...or varied streams....of civilisation. Thus Jesus and Yahwe--and all the folklore behind them--mean no more to me than Apollo or Thor or Tanit or Huitzilopochtli; and do not command my study and attention than do these fellow-objects of deific regard. Hence my lack of special scholarship in their direction. What interests me is the whole human pageant, and not any especial corner of it except so far as environment and caprice have given me a particular concern for Anglo-Saxon civilisation in the modern world and Roman civilisation in the ancient world...a concern not exclusive enough to destroy the scope and objectivity of my larger general perspective. It is, then, only as an incident of history that the question of Christ's personality, origin, existence, or non-existence, interests me. I have not explored the subject in detail, and do not pretend to have any
