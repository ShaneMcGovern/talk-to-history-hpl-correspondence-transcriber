P.S. Enclosed is a little magazine with some of my stuff--which you may find momentarily amusing.

My dear Dr. de Castro:

I am sorry to note that you hold such a sceptical and critical opinion concerning my present predicament of excessive work and nerve strain, since the misconception places me in an undeservedly unfavorable light.

The facts are simply these: That I have, for the past year or more, undertaken more literary obligations than can possibly be discharged in the 16 hours per day which form the maximum normal schedule of work. To imagine that the given amount of labour can be compressed into a shorter time is to err. There is no way to do that except by lowering the quality of the work, and this I will not do. Therefore I have tried to overcome the difficulty by taking hours from my sleep period--sometimes cutting out a night's rest (and in some cases 2 continuous nights) in order to clean up a crowded programme. But this will do no longer serve. It diminishes my power of concentration, causes me to do poor work, induces spells of unconquerable drowsiness, weakness, and inability to think, and even upsets my digestion. I have had these spells before when similarly overworked--either in school or in connexion with revision--especially in 1906, 1908, and 1916. Common sense ought to show that, when in such a dilemma, I cannot very well "forget my nervousness" and take on more work!!! Would it help to stop sleeping altogether (as I would naturally have to do in order to handle more work when my programme already contains far more than I can do in 16 hours per day!) and assume fresh obligations which I could not possibly perform? Is that unwise and suicidal procedure necessary to the realisation of the motto "never say die"? I, myself, think it is
