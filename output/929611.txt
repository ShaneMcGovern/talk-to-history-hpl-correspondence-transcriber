veers based on the Christian concept of virtue, but always on the strength-prideful Teutonic concept of honour. We can laugh good-naturedly when anyone tells us we are unjust, vicious, or impious (i.e., delinquent in our relations to the governing forces of the universe), but are aroused to the fighting point when anyone dares question our honour (i.e., the straightforwardness of a man so strong that he has no need for subterfuge) or independence or courage. The difference in our instinctive emotions when confronted by these two different types of ethical attack is tremendously significant as regards the placement of our real and profound loyalties. Thus in spite of all the centuries of ostensible Christian belief we are not Christians except in name. It would be honest and less hypocritical if we had continued to adhere to the polytheistic pantheism which is our culture's natural heritage, which therefore more truly embodies its expressions what we really think and feel. A system synthesizing the best of Epicureanism and Stoicism would have served us much better than our accidental importation has done. It is, however, rather late is the day to change back - especially since the part played by any religion in the life of our civilization is rapidly waning. Forces and feelings for removed from the ecclesiastical are the things which really concern in the crisis of transition around us.

I'm glad to hear that your eyes are better. I hope that you may keep them so through a careful avoidance of overstrain. I hope, too, that you can arrange for the revision and publication of some of the fascinating arts which you have in reserve. Better write any friend Price about the first. My right that I can't help at present is really what's mine - as I've said, if you don't find someone else in this interim, I'll notify you when I can begin some very gradual work on a tale. It and now I must get to work - the pile of stuff a head of me being so wall-appealing! All good wishes.
